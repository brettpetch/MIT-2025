# Initialization
After reading week -- Popular news article due.
Feb. 25 -- Class will be held entirely online in OWL.

Thanks for coming, I thought this would be a small group because of midterms. I think this is a very useful lecture, but it is very light. It's not a lot of content, but hopefully it gives you something to think about. After the week after reading week will be online or interactive. Tutorials are happening the week after. You will be able to focus on writing your news article which will be challenging.

Announcement: Case Logics - Shannon Mattern
- Urban Studies, architecture and data. She brings it all together in interesting ways around design. She's an anthropologist, prolific and has really cool ideas. The same day, she will be talking in the Graduate Library (3rd Floor FIMS at noon). Talk will be moderated by Melissa Adler. It will be a chance to interact more with her than in the public talk. If you have questions, please contact Melissa Adler (prof.). 

# Research Creation
Today, we'll be talking about research creation. This is what your final project will be about. To ensure we are all on the same page, your news article is due in tutorial. On the 25th, this will be an online lecture, BUT WILL HAVE TUTORIAL. Some of you will be handing in your data tomorrow and some of you are handing it in after reading week. After reading week, we will be doing coding and analysis. We will start doing quantitative unit later... coding and qualitative analysis. Then you will be doing the final project.

Now that you are starting to get into the project, you'll want to figure out how to express in a research project. Spend some time defining research creation.

Canadian term, it's interchangable with these other terms: multi-modal research, Multimodal Research, Arts-based Research, Practice-based Research, Performative Social Science. The American context calls it 'Arts-based Research', however I think it's limited. Think about creativity in a much more expansive way. Discussing research findings, etc. rather than a research paper, etc. Journal, news article, etc. not traditionally thought about... Practice-based research, performative social science. All of these are different ways to think about the findings you come up with. 

All of these terminologies are used differently based on context. Canadians discuss as "Research Creation". These can be broken down into Knowledge mobilization and knowledge translation. Imagine that there is an intended and purpose. What are you trying to do with this research, mobilize your knowledge and findings. This is also knowledge translation. I want you to put it into a form your audience will recieve well. This may be a clear discussion of your findings, a critique of, response to or transformation of... Give it meaning to your intended audience. 

The definition from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council:

TL;DR (SSHRC) has made research creation a focal point. They have funded research that falls under this branch (monetary reward). There are ways that are unconventional to get the message out there. To develop this, SSHRC has been trying to get this funding... 

The talk by Shannon Mattern is part of a maker and thinker series. There is something about the creative process, by thinking differently, seeing it differently, we are able to put it out into the world and help others see it the same way. It's very iterative, communicative and participatory process. 

I Want you to take some risks, failure will not be penalized as long as you show your thought processes. 

### Enabling constraints

### Create problems
The best research is the kind of research that creates more questions. It needs to make people think differently and create a dialogue. If you are putting together something out there, hopefully it will inspire dialogue and engage people in new problems and questions.

### Think in Movement
There is a recognition that we can think by making or doing. There is a making process, doing something different than writing, you will see something differently. I want you to reflect, think by doing, engaging, experimenting and by thinking and that's the idea of research creation, no matter what it is. There is an aspect to it in a policy mindset, making thing. Arts, policy, all over the place

### Note Emergences
This content analysis is iterative, I want you to be comfortable with how it moves, etc. Be ok with movements in research itself. Thinking like Stuart Hall, etc. representations of the media, translating and making. It's more than just representing our findings.

### Creativity at Work
For those of you who might be a bit daunted by creativity, I think you're proficient in production courses, etc. You may feel as if you are one of the creative types. I want you to look at this creativity at work quote. Coming from a business perspective. Hopefully we are building a foundation for thinking about this.

# Grading
You will not be graded on the artistic aspect. We are interested in:
1. Does the project reflect a critical engagement with the course material?
2. Is the medium appropriate for hte research project? Have you exploited the medium and its attendant technologies effectively?
3. Is the project original and creative?
4. Does it deliver a message or offer insights based onthe findings of the research? Is there an identifiable argument or thesis at the hear of the project? 
5. Is that message legible for the intended audience? Is there enough context? Can this project stand alone?
6. Does the project "make clear its web of influence and...

I encourage you to see all of these.  I want to jump down to Jeremy Dutcher. He will be coming to FIMS in 5 weeks from now. He is an extraordinary performer, he is indiginous and did his project out east, working with wolastoq songs from 1907. They were recorded on wax cylinders. The idea of indiginizing and reclaiming. He has put himself in dialogue with these people from over a century ago. He has written music that is similar. I am going to play one of his pieces. I don't expect you to have skills like this necessarily, but look at how they came from research.
