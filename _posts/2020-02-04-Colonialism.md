## Due this Week:
Write a letter to a tech company or a government agency based on this weekâ€™s materials.

# Ethics
Today, we are going to talk about research ethics, colonialism and de-colonialism. This week's online refine is for you to write to a letter to a government agency, etc. This is about decolonising research ethics. This is about how to do research with people, well. Why you can't use human participants: the reason is because there are living human participants. There are certifications and procedures required to do any research that involves humans. Content on the web (publicly available). People do, at times want their data to not be used. For our purposes, you can use it for your research project. If you feel like you're being intrusive or invasive, be aware that you are using it and repurposing for your project.

These are created by the Tri-Council. For us, our human subjects research are under CIHR. These agencies are funded directly by federal funding. This is required for any survey, anonymous or not.
The Tri-Council Statement is a joint policy of Canada's three federal research agencies -- CIHR, NSERC and SSHRC. 
> "To be eligible ot receive and administer research funds from the Agencies, institutions must agree to comply with a number of Agency policies set out..."
## Core Ethical principles:

1. **Respect for persons**
> recognizes the intrinsic value of human beings and the respect and consideration that are due.

2. **Concern for Welfare**
> The impact on the individuals of factors such as their physical, mental and spiritual health, as well as their physical, economic and social circumstances.

3. **Justice**
> The obligation to treat people fairly and equitably


These ethics should be followed at all times. You need to understand that if you were to talk about peoples past drug use, it could be an issue.

Part of the reason these guidelines have been drawn up are because they have been violated. There are many cases where... Much of the research that has happened in indigenous communities has violated. Much of the research of the communities might be in support of a career, university, etc. but it may not help the community that we are doing research on. For example, this could be artefacts in a museum. This could be scientists, etc. taking things and putting them in the museum.

## Informed Consent:
I'm going to highlight a few things. Perhaps one of the most important is informed consent. Participation must always be voluntary. There may be certain cases where you have that waived. You may go to the review board and waive consent, if it is pertinent to your results. We do want our participants involved. We want to make sure participants can withdraw at any point without punishment. I previously worked at University of Kentucky.

They sent a survey to the faculty with many questions. People had to answer: Faculty, sexual orientation, department. These surveys were highly identifiable. These very personal details were not for me. I had clicked on yes, I agree to participate because I didn't want to participate. Recently, there was a survey at Western with very similar reasons for dismissal. Adding to this, you want to give people enough information that they are not feeling coerced, vulnerable, etc. 

To get personal, my mother got lung cancer, she was stage 4 and they were trying experimental drugs. They told her that there was a chance that if she tried these, that she could survive. She felt like there was some hope. The treatments were very toxic and didn't work. Typically we are not dealing with life and death, but the communities may feel harm. We want to ensure that there is no emotional, physical or mental issues that could emerge. People are giving you personal information. 

Terms and conditions need to be documented. You want to make sure your participants have enough time.

## Privacy
I want to alert you to this. Do not go into people's private accounts. This is a violation of personal privacy. We need to keep identities anonymous of those participating and that the data gathered remains confidential. That it's secure etc.
