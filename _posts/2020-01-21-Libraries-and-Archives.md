## Introduction
Open TV Platform: working with people of colour, minorities, etc... See [Course Website](https://research-methods-digital-age.com/home/week-3-libraries)

Today, we'll be talking about archives, then reserving our 2nd hour to run ideas by TAs, Prof, etc. Ask questions. This is going to be very workshoppy. When you go to tutorial, combine efforts.

If you find 5 things, and 5 people in your group, then you effectively have 25 things to talk about. Stay. It'll be worth your time. 

## Archives
We're going to talk about the video, Deb Majer-Fraser, graduate of FIMS. The way she found her path, she did masters, became an archivist, then found another path: London has a large need for archival projects for people in local communities. Eg. Families, etc. She is helping by publishing books on Family Histories, etc... 

### National Archives
Blurring of content in the national archives: things about body parts, censoring Trump out of images. The statement they gave is tied to what we were talking about last week about Framing..
>"As a non-partisan, non-political federal agency, we blurred references to the President's name on some posters, so as not to egage in current political controversy," archives spokeswoman Miriam Kleiman said in an emailed statement. "Our mission is to safeguard and provide access to the nation's most important federal records, and our exhibits are one way in which we connect the American people to those records. Modifying the image was an attempt on our part to keep the focus on the records."

## Are the Archives on Fire?
She's trying to say that there is plenty of work to be done with archives and that the labour of archives are important. Often, archives will burn during political movements. There is recognition that there is huge loss of archives. 

### Archivists
In the library, and in archives: metadata is collected, but all of it is choices. In archives work, there is a category called "Acquisition". Let's say that a box of things comes in... You have to evaluate the documents, is the family willing to allow part of the collection to be released, or the whole thing. Where they are, what they're about, do they have value  to the institution? 

There is a vast room in Western that has boxes and boxes in a warehouse. It's a huge collection that you would otherwise not know were here. 

### Humanists
These people take the material and contextualize it. They tell a story about it. There are many many things in this archive that can tell a story, if properly contextualized.

### The Archival Record
is composed of recorded knowledge. Archivists are changing their definition to memories, which contain material traces, etc. The mind being a space where archival memory is also installed and how it's tied to what we call archives. The documented memories come together in the archive. When it becomes archival, when we mke things accessable, etc. they have become activated by users depending on the users and the use.

We have to think about this kind of thing as being co-created.

### Humanists and archivists in dialogue
Regarding the space of the library as a place of collaberation between archivists and the people doing the research. The things that people tend to critique about archives is that they're thought to be Government Archives. For the most part, our standards come from government authorities and beurocratic institution. Now there is more focus on community archives. 

### Derrida
Wrote this piece around 1995 for a conference held at Freud's House. He's thinking through psychoanalytic concepts, etc. Most important is deconstruction, and how he does this is challenging binaries, which even today need to be questioned. In 1995, this was not accepted. One of the ways he approaches deconstruction is he uses historical methods to find something intended to discover something unintended. Eg. Library, Archive being good public institution. Derrida would uncover the history of the archive / library and look at the history (government oriented). Alot of interesting stuff in colonial studies challenge the way it's studied.

It was Freud's home, but most of his papers were sent to the Library of Congress (US)

Wants to look at archives and where they're coming from. How it reinforces laws and colonial authority.

What I want us to think about is when something is archived what is the ideology going into them, etc. There is a way that the archives use eras.

First, i'd like to talk about my own archival research coming out of the archive myself.

### Doing Archival Research
I went to the Library of Congress for a Research Trip, originally I thought it was about the sexualities, looked at the catalogue found a book called "The Bisexual...". The subject of the book was "perversion" I wanted to know where it came from, what it meant, and that became the dissertation for one of my paper. In 2007, they allowed this term to be used. Older records still have this deviation. Now they don't use that term for LGBTQ topics. Have you heard about the Delta Collection, which is about obscenities. No one knows anything about the secret collection. Office of the Keeper of Records. He was charged for keeping the collection of obscenty... There was a worry about sexual perversion, communism. Federal agencies really policed people's sexuality. If you were determined to be a possible deviant, you would be investigated and later fired. Post was monitored, post office would open things they were suspicious of obscenity. No one wanted to be associated with this, no one knew how to manage the collection. 

No one could just ask for the collection. Anything with explicit material was seized. While doing the research, I found that even though the collection was denied access. The pages of many were mutilated. People would take a razor blade to remove images / materials. There was an FBI investigation; discovered that it's likely the work of a 'sexual pervert'. He had been investigated, the man in charge of the delta collection was thought to be guilty. 

Hopefully, that gives you some context into archival research if you have questions, please ask. If there are any screenwriters in this class, I'd like to write a screenplay. In terms of sexual policing, etc...

## Libraries and the Public Sphere
A lot of us really care about the public sphere, public libraries are very important to the public sphere. There is the idea that they hold information for every member of the public. The London Public Library just started checking out musical insturments. Serve as centres for readings, etc. the democratic ideal is upheld. Information is hosted for all, something really interested in contrast to things like search engines. Concerned about censorship, equity of access, privacy, etc. These are really important information about the public sphere. At the same time, there is also things like critical information studies. Others look at the epistmeological study of archives. We can look at how they act as a medium, act as a medium and what kind of ideology is built into any kind of archive. Alot of things we see in archives, etc. work is based in the architectures. Metadata is regarded as being created by Librarians. Archivists bring question to Libraries and the public sphere, specifically the information.

Library of congress in 1857, thiccc stacks of pages. 

They needed to come up with the Library of Congress Classification.

Organization of knowledge within disciplines is closely related to LoCC.

Foucault
> The Disciplines characterize, classify, specialize; they distribute along a scale, around a nrom, hierachize individuals in relation to one another and, if necessary, disqualify and invalidate. 
- Foucault, Discipline and Punish (223)
We encounter knowledge in relation to that vantage point. He talks about prisons, schools, archives. Libraries are the way that information flows. 

### Community Archvies
in partnership, collaberation with communities, what are the standards, etc. Maybe breaking from terms the government archvie would suggest. Also need to think about who can access things, where, when. What to keep, what to call it. 

## Research Questions from Last Week:
As we launch into this, we are going to look at the Kate and Meghan

> How does race play into the expectations of motherhood in the royal family?

Because we're using content analysis as a method of research, how would we be able to research this quesiton given the resources we have. If you wanted to think about this question, you might want to look at these representations inside the media. Get at the real essentials: How is something depicted in some kind of media? 

> Is the celebrity status of Meghan an influence on how she is represented in the media?

We may see reference, we are going to have to operationalize this, saying this is because of this. How will we know that any given representation is because of celebrity status. \

> How does the media represent Meghan in relation to her career?

We want to ensure your findings **are valid**. 

> In what ways does race play a role in the differences in tone of headlines written about Kate vs. Meghan?

as you're researching this, you'd need to know that this is becaue of race. how do you know it's about race rather than her celebrity, etc. Ensure what you're doing is consise. 

## For the Next While:
Look at your research question or topic. What kind of media are you looking at? Are you looking at postcards, picture books, etc. Begin to find content and see if you can find things related to your question, etc. When you go to tutorial you will hopefully share and compare. 

If you get confused look at the syllabus.  The Table is really Great.
Next week your content analysis is needed.
