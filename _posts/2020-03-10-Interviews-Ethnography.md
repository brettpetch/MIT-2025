##### Prof. Melissa Adler

## Guest Lecture: From Radio
Kirstyn Seanor & Alex Mayhew

The So What Podcast was published by students at LIS, they have been running for 2 years, they're figuring out how to become more sustainable and embedded in the faculty. To talk about interviews, which is a central part of a podcast. Finding a really human element behind a story. You need considerations, etc. for interview subjects. They can recognize things by building over nervy subjects. Ensure your questions meet one subject, and make sure you find a difference between an open and closed question, it's useful to vary what kinds of questions they might need to dig into. Similarly, you want to ensure you're asking questions relevant to a topic. It's also a way to respect someone. If you have someone in to talk about the homeless people in london, but ask something like what's your most recent twitter fight?

Sometimes, asking if there are specific questions that we need to address, giving questions prior to interview, etc. Plan ahead your questions and the narrative you want to tell. It's great for talking to your audience. When interviewing, chat with the person beforehand, enables people to sound natural. Oh, can we rephrase [x], make sure they are able to present the most polished version of things. There's a wide spectrum of structure you may need / want to use to ensure the story is told correctly. If you were wanting to talk to 4 people for data storage structures in games. Someone playing games from before, then to now.

I like to find someone who has a different perspective, but i'd rather talk to someone as a co-contributor to the conversation, for instance one of the older episodes (0.2 A Conversation on Ageing and Death) I thought it would be interesting to sit down with this person and I think that because of the organic nature it enabled a natural exploration. Additionally, in 1.4 Memoirs of a Semi-Reofrmed Troll, who has heard of the hero's journey, TL;DR: so basically, what I did was I wanted the episode to bring the audience on the journey that the interview subject went on: What got you started? Inciting Incident? etc. Make your interview subject [The Hero]. There are also things like interview subjects you could rely on. 

How you play in your inverview is a lot about your own style, as well as being clear about what you want, letting them know that an episode is live, etc. ensure you build trust with members of the community. Just a quick question: Who has thought of making a podcast before? 

I'd like to reiterate the importance of storytelling. This story is ~2500 years old: Plato & Aristotle; plato thought that heaven was where everything important was and aristotle thought that the world held everything important. The human was a featherless biped; plucked a chicken and said ok, here's a featherless biped. A better defentition of a human might be a storytelling animal. As far as we know, we are the only ones to repeat, embelish, and carry on stories over generations. There are stories that we interact with everyday that make the world exist. Think of money: they work because we agree that it is something that we will buy into: laws, communities, cultures, ethics: by multiple communities of these stories we agree that this is something of our own.

If you are going to be producing a podcast, etc. you want to ensure you are doing research, and that it backs up that story. I'm now going to talk about editing. Who here really enjoys editing papers, audio, etc. When I decided to make this particular episode, I realized that I could minimize the amount of editing I had to do. Locate the breath marks, take them out, edit out a 20 min interview to a 15 min interview. The person I was talking to wasn't really stuttery. Planning ahead makes editing a lot easier. Ensure your volume is normalized. 

Alot of what they were saying applies to almost any project. I want you to remember that their medium could be anything like a radio play, it doesn't just have to be an interview; if it's the best choice to you.
