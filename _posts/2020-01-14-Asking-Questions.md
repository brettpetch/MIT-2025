## Today: Lecture on asking questions and framing
First element of the research project is about asking questions, specifically how the framing, or the way you ask a question will help shape your project.
You will likely start off too broad, but your data will soon come. You will be looking at different databases.

## Questions: 
### What are the effects of climate change on Canadian Farmers
- this question is not for use in the course, but you would want to go talk to Canadian farmers.
- This question is still very broad. We need to be precise about the terms we use. We need to narrow down to types of farms, locate (wildfires, draught), etc. do a more investigative report; do field research, talk to people directly etc.

### How is climate change portrayed in fiction?
- You'd still want to narrow scope; what are you wanting to look at (there are alot of types of fiction).
- Think about regions, dates, etc. 
- This might be the kind of question you hand in for 1st assignment. (5 lit sources, lit review)

### What are the best things individuals can do to reverse climate change?
- this would also need some work
- how would we work this into content analysis?
- What do social media feeds indicate people should do to lower their impact on climate change?

### How do the meida depict animal suffering?
- think about what media, how suffering is defined, etc. we need to make our terms operable.
- looking toward social media feed, news articles, etc.
- We are going to want to look at animal suffering etc.

### Hypothesis: News media's depictions of climate change denial decreased in 2019
- These testable kinds of hypothesis
- Social media feeds are more likely to show what you can do...

### Hypothosis: social media feeds are most likely to show what individuals can do for climate change (eg. eliminate straws)
- We have room built into the assignment to refine questions
- Your research decisions should be driven by your questions

## Asking Questions
We really want you to have enough familiarity with your subject they you're not going in blind. What are your interests in this topic? Why? As you're doing that process, you need to contribute to your own knowledge. How is researching this topic / questions contributing to broader understanding.

### Good Questions
- Clear, unambiguous, easily understood.
- Specific, suggest the that must be collected.
- Researchable and feasible.
    - ensure you have access to the data you are wanting.
- Connected with concepts and phenomena.
- Relevant to the field.
- Lead to research that matters.

### Things to think about:
- Who is your audience?
- What is your purpose?
- Understanding processes or phenomena
- Make reccomendations for policy or practice?
- Critique?
- Respond to debates
- Test users / usability
- Local planning, outreach, programming initiatives, needs assessment?

## Literature Search
- Determine keywords, subjects, etc.

> We are doing Qualitative research aims to understand how people think about the world and how they act and behave in it. This approach requires researchers to understand phenomena based on discourse, actions and documents, and how and why individuals interperet and ascribe meaning to what they say and do, and other aspects of the world (including other people) they encounter." 
> - Tri-Council Policy Statement

## Methodological Practices
- inductive understanding
- diversity of approaches
- dynamic, reflective and continuous research process
- diverse mutiple and often evolving contexts
- data collection and sample size
- dynamic, negotiated and ongoing consent process.

## Framing: Seven deadly sins of journalism
- First sin: continue having the wrong debates about climate change (asking questions)
- Second sin: leaving climate change to the natural sciences (methods, epistemological concerns, what counts as knowledge, as valid)
- Third sin: treating climate change as a green issue
- Fourth sin: thinking that decarbonization = loss
- Fifth sin: generalizing responsiblity for climate change.
- Sixth sin: Failing ot see the bigger picture
- Seventh sin: Underselling climate change

These relate to the state we are at on our research project. If the first sin is continuting to have the wrong debate about climate change, they are saying that the journalists are engaging the wrong ideas. Not to quote fox news, but media entities want to appear "fair and balanced". The writers are saying we need to look at the lived experiences instead of just looking at numbers. 

### BBC on Framing Climate Change
> To achieve impartiality, you do not need to include outright deniers of climate change in BBC coverage, in the same way you would not have someone denying that Macnchester United won 2-0 last Saturday. The referee has spoken."

### Marshall McLuhan
> "One function of a theory in the hands of a scientist is to prod reality into revealing itself.... A good, elegant theory will describe a wide array of observations and predict the results of new ones."

### Using theory or to build from it 
- frame inquiry and analysis
- ensure you don't bring too much theory into the project.
- to enter into a conversation in a common language.
- may bring more meaning or relevance.
- think of it as a toolkit that frames a way of seeing and analyzing
- We might add to the theory, challenge it, build from it
- We can use it in new and different contexts
- marxism, critical race theory, foucault.

## The research article: incorperate everything, provide background, etc.
this project has you do a variety of things, it's content analysis, etc. is akin to what we are going to do in this class. You are going to attempt science journalism, it should incorperate various elements.

Ensure your sources of data include (but are not limited to): Advertisements, Twitter (hashtags, epecially), Instagram (comments, images, etc.), comics, news articles, websites, song lyrics, music videos, legislative documents, policy documetns, metadata, tv show clips, course outlines, reports...
